# HypothesisTesing to affirm/negate hypotheses related to click-through rates of Amazon

Two- sided t-test
Test if total spending in May is same as total spending in Dec

Null: May same as December
Alternate: May spending! == December spending
Two- sided t-test
p-value> alpha we can do not reject the null hypothesis.So,there is difference in spending.

F-test to comapre Varainces
Executives believe that variance in Dec is greater than variance in Nov--

Null: Variances are equal
Alternate: Variances are unequal. i.e. Variance in December>Variance in November.
p-value greater than alpha so reject null and accept alternative that ratio of variances is greater than 1.
So, the claim H1 and reject NULL: There is enough evidence to support the claim.

Compute CTR---CTR=0.01996257


Nature of correlation: since p-value is far less than alpha
Null Hypothesis: H0: ρ = 0
Alternate Hypothesis: Ha: ρ ≠ 0
Reject the NULL.
If the test concludes that the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, we say that the correlation coefficient is “significant.”
Correlation between impressions and clicks? What does it intuitively mean?
A correlation between click and impression is a positive relation. And correlation here is the strongest that means optimizing to viewable correlations is a better proxy for a brand advertiser than a click-through rate.
